# **App Name**: BusGuardian AI

## Core Features:

- Sensor Input Simulation: Interactive UI to simulate engine and cabin sensor data (temperature, coolant, ventilation, camera input).
- Gemini-Powered Chatbot: AI chatbot powered by the Gemini API, designed to answer questions about bus overheating, physics of heat transfer, and the monitoring system.
- Overheating Detection & Prediction: AI-powered tool that analyzes simulated sensor data to detect overheating conditions, predict likely causes (low coolant, blocked vents), and provide suggestions.
- Physics Explanation Section: Dedicated UI section explaining conduction, convection, and radiation in the context of bus heat management.
- Project Summary: UI section summarizing how the system improves safety, comfort, and fuel efficiency using physics and AI.
- API Integration: Connect sensor data to the Gemini API for real-time overheating analysis and chatbot interaction.
- Chat History: Store and display the user's conversation history with the Gemini API powered chatbot, providing context to the LLM when the user asks further questions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#1A237E) to evoke trust and reliability in the system's monitoring capabilities.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), providing a clean, neutral backdrop that allows data and insights to stand out.
- Accent color: Yellow-Orange (#FFAB40) for alerts, warnings, and calls to action, effectively drawing user attention to critical information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, ensuring readability and a modern, objective feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear, intuitive icons to represent sensor data (temperature, coolant level, ventilation) and system status (normal, warning, critical).
- Divide the UI into logical sections: Sensor Input, Chatbot, Physics Explanation, Project Summary.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide the user through the simulation and analysis process.
